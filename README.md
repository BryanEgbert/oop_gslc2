Abstract class and interface are very similar, but there is a difference.  
**Interface:**
- a contract that when a class implements it, it should contains that function
- a class can implements multiple interface

**Abstract class:**
- a class that cannot be initialized
- abstract class is meant to be extended by other classes
- a class can only extend one abstract class
